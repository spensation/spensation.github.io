title:  Qualifying Life Event - A Career Transition

I am choosing to become a programmer for very practical reasons.  Last year my wife and I became pregnant for the first time.  I knew then and there that my life as an actor/musician and a freelance theater artist was nearing its end.  As I saw it, my career transition was either going to be a move to more administrative work in the arts or try to embrace something alltogether different.  In September, I started dabbling in some free code lessons online.  By November, I was hooked.  Where I once spent my free time playing guitar or piano, I was spending all of my time working on a snippet of code.  I was obsessed with turning red to green.  When the new year came, I decided to invest in a proper education.  I consulted with a family friend who had recently transitioned from opera singer to software engineer.  She recommended Flatiron and the rest is history.
