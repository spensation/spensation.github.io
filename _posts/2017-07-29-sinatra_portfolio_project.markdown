Working on this Sinatra Project has been a great learning experience.  It's rustic, my attempt at a RESTful website, but I have to say that I am pretty proud of myself for getting it done.  The deeper I get into this pool of web development, the farther away the floor seems to get.  There is just so much to know!  At times I feel that I am getting a handle on certain elements of process that felt nearly impossible just a month ago.  Then again, I think that I am struggling to create something that a real developer would churn out in a few minutes.  Lets be clear, this did not take me a few minutes to make!  

I kicked around a couple of ideas before landing on my chore wheel app.  I was actually in Chicago, visiting an old roommate of mine from the group living in San Francisco days, when it occured to me.  I got excited about the idea and got to work almost immediately.  After a couple sessions working on the code, I was disheartened because it felt out of reach.  I was having a hard time understanding how to relate my tables in order to make this thing work.  

I tried to start simply.  I ditched the chore wheel and created a task list.  It worked but I felt unsatisfied.  Eventually, I decided to pick up the chore wheel idea and try again.  It's taken me longer than I wanted to spend on this project, but I like the result.  I think I will be able to expand on this app for my Rails project.
