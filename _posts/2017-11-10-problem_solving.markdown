Life is funny.  A year ago I was happily going about my business as an underemployed actor making ends meet as a freelance stage hand and aerial dance rigger.  Life was pretty good.  I wasn't basking in fame or fortune or anything but I had  a good mix of creative projects, easy money gigs and impossible problems to solve.  I'll spare you, kind reader, all the gory details but I do want to focus on the (seemingly) impossible projects because I think there is a corrolation to my current pursuit of becoming a programmer.

In brief, I grew up in a theater.  Not literally, of course, but I caught the bug when I was 8 years old and I never wanted to find the cure.  Now I realize that becoming a parent is the cure.  The point is that I was young and eager to help and learn all the things that went on to make the magic happen.  By the time I was 13 I had landed a summer job at the local theater as a dustmop.  They would send me up to the catwalks to clean the lighting instruments and bring down the ones that needed repairs.  Easy enough.  

During high school, the shows got bigger and the carpenters always needed help completing the scenery during the final week of rehearsals.  I would stay after rehearsals to help.  At first it was to paint or clean up but eventually, I was building right along with the crew.

By the time I got to college, I had amassed a pretty decent skill set and landed a job in the scene shop.  The university sponsered a summer stock festival were I started to work as a scenic carpenter after my sophmore year.  On the first day of the summer, as my boss was assigning the crew to our respective teams, I was given an assignment that would impact my life for many years.  Unlike the other dozen or more carpenters who were off to butcher wood and crudely weld tubular steel together, I was to be the master rigger's assistant.  That summer, for the first time, I made some real theater magic happen.  I was also having to deal with applied physics, like all day long.

The show was Shakespeare's Richard III.  The set was a series of three ever larger steel cages that served to frame (or trap) the actors throughout the show.  It was big, heavy, and needed to run as smooth as silk.  The issue was that, and bear with me because this gets a little wonkish, the stage was not a traditional procenium with a fly system.  This was all happening on a thrust, which means the stage juts out into the house and the audience sits on three sides of the action.
To be clear, it was lunacy.  We sets points, diverted lift lines around architecture, we had ot build an arbor system for the counterweight. (The biggest move was in the range of 1,000 Lbs).  In the end, it was a big success and I got hired to rig another, even crazier show the next summer.

This has all been a long way around to the fact that I spent the next 20 years (egad!) working as a rigger.  Ok, so I pulled a lot of points and sweated countless buckets about how many thousands of pounds were on this beam or that point, so what?  Well, there's more to it than that.  While a few rigging projects, including that first summer, were in a theater, most of my work has been in what is called site specific performance.  (This is what happens when an artist walks into a space where they probably shouldn't be and says something like, "I have a crazy idea...".)  So I'm tasked with moving scenery or dancers through nontraditional performance spaces, like the forest, the airport, an active contruction site.  The application of the laws of physics gets weird in a non controlled environment.  Actually, and I think this is the point of all this; like logic, the laws of physics are immutable.  GIven the seemingly impossible task, I have learned not to fight these laws, but to use them to my advantage in whatever setting I find myself.
